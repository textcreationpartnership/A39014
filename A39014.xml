            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>GEometry</hi> is a Greek word, which in its proper signification telleth us of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then measuring of the Earth: Nevertheless, by this word we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the principal Part of the Mathematicks, which is a Science that hath for its Object Quantity continued.</p>
            <p>A continued quantity is that wherof all the parts are joined together, as are all sorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, Greatness, and Dimensions.</p>
            <p>And these Dimensions consist principally either in Lines, Angles, Superficies, or Bodies, which are to be considered, not according to the Quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of the Matter, but according to the Extension of the parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geometry</hi> is divided into the Theorick, and the Practick. The Theorick is the Science which causeth us to conceive and demonstrate the truth of Geometrical Propositions. And the Practick is the Art which guideth the hand in its Operation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geometry</hi> had its beginning amongst the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> which were compelled to invent it, for to remedy the disorder that hapned ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily within their Grounds, by the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> which carried away all the Bounds, and defaced all the Limit-marks
<pb facs="tcp:31438:4"/> of their Inheritances: and so this Exercise, which for the time consisted only in measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the lands, for to render to every one that which belonged to him, was called the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of the earth or <hi>Geometry:</hi> but in process of time the <hi>Egyptians</hi> applied themselves to more subtile enquities, and by degrees from an Exercise altogether Mechanical, they brought forth this excellent Science, which hath deserved to hold one of the chiefest ranks amongst all others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geometry</hi> is not only profitable, but we may say it is altogether necessary. It is by this the <hi>Astrologians</hi> make their observations; they know the extent of the Heavens, duration of times, Moving of the Stars, observations of the seasons of the Years and Ages.</p>
            <p>It is by this the Geographers do cause us to see at one cast of an Eye the Greatness of the whole earth the huge extension of the seas the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Empir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. Kingdoms and Provinces</p>
            <p>It is from this the Architects do take their just measures in framing of publick Buildings, as well as o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> particular houses.</p>
            <p>It is by the help of this Engineers do bring to pass all their intended projects, whereby they take the scituation and plat-form of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
<pb facs="tcp:31438:4"/> distance of places, and that they can at length carry their measure through Spaces acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible only to the sight.</p>
            <p>Persons of quality, whose Birth engageth them to the wars, are obliged to apply themselvs to this Science. It introduceth them not only to fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which teacheth them to build bulwarks, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend strong places but also to compose and set up Engines which may overthrow them and further also it brings them to very much knowledge and skill in the Military Art, how to o der an Army for battel, how to encamp and divide Ground for quartering; likewise, it teacheth them to make Maps of countreys, to take the platform of towns, forts and castles, to measure all kind of dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both accessible and inacc ssible, to invent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; lastly, it maketh them so expert and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for their Wit and Inventions, as they can be for any st ength or couragiousnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Workman must yet proceed further, and learn to know how to change a Triangle into a Quadrangle, and also at last bring it to a right Quadrate, to the which I will set down divers formes. First, take a Triangle with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven corners, as A. B. C. and divide the Base, (which is the name of all lower lines) B. C. in two even parts, and there place the Letter E. Then from the point E. to A. draw a line, which will divide the Triangle into two even parts. Then if you take that part which is marked A. E. C. and joyn it to the other part, marked A. E B. it will make a Quadrangle, as A. D. B. E, made of a Triangle.</p>
               <p>YOu may also change this Triangle in other manner, dividing the lines A. B. and A. C. each in two like parts as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. and G. Then draw a line through D. E. as long as the Base B. C. Then shut up the two Equidistances, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wise: and then the Quadrangle B. C. D. E contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so much in it as the Triangle A. B. C. and the proof thereof is, that the two Triangles B. C. F. and G E. C. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so much in them, as the two other Triangles A. F. H. and A. I. G.</p>
               <p>A Triangle with even points, may be divided thrice into two equal parts, dividing each side in two parts, as in the Figure P. <hi>Q.</hi> R. it is seen through the three lines, which on either side make two great Triangles.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31438:11"/>

               <p>THe same Triangle P. Q. R. may thus be changed into a Quadrangle: divide the side P. Q. and the side P. R. each in two equal parts, then draw a line S. T. as long as Q. and R, and then draw a line direct downward from T. R. to close it up: and then that Quadrangle contains as much space within it as the Triangle aforesaid, because that the Triangle which is cut off P. S. V. is of like great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with the other Triangle marked V. R. T.</p>
               <p>ANd although there is a Triangle of unequal sides, yet a man may make it a Quadrangle, in such sort as I said before of the right Triangle: for although the two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles that are cut off, and those two that are added unto it, are not of one greatness, yet the Triangles A. F. L. and B. D. F. are one as great as the other: and again, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles A. G. K. and G. C. E. are also of one greatness: so that those that are cut off, and those that are added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, are of one quantity. By these alterations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, a man may easily measure how many feet, ells or roods foursquare, are contained in a three-corner'd <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT it falleth out, that a Triangle, (which is three cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd) <hi>superficie</hi> or plain, must be parted cross-wise in two equal parts: then out of one of the sides that you will cut through, you must make a right four square, as from the side A. B. and draw therein two Diagonus from corner to corner, which will shew you the Center C. and draw one Circle through that three-corner'd part, which you will divide, and so you shall finde the two points, where you shall draw your dividing line He that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any proof hereof, may take each piece, and alter it into a Quadrangle, and after into a Quadrate, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall be shewed, and he shall find it true,</p>

               <p>AN Architector must also undergo other Burthens, for that he must know how to divide a piece of ground, that no man may be hindred thereby. As for Example, if there were a piece of ground that lay three-corner'd wise, with unequal parts, having on the one side thereof a Well, but not in the middle: and this ground, or three-corner'd piece of Land is to be divided into two equal parts, in such sort, that each of them may have the use of the Well: it must be done in this manner. I make a Triangle marked A B. C. and the Well is marked with G. Now divide the line B. C. with a dark line in the two equal parts as the Letter D. sheweth, and then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a line from D. to A. then the Triangle is divided into two equal parts: but both of them cannot yet come to the Well: then draw another line from the Well G. to A. and from the point D. you must set an Equidistancie against G. A. marked with E. and drawing from G. which is the Well: the black line to the letter E it will divide the ground in two even several parts, and each of them shall have the VVell at the end of his Ground, for that part A. B. G. E. containeth in it just as many feet or roods, as that part which is marked G. E. C.</p>
               <p>I Shewed before, how a man should make a four square Superficies once as great again as it is, but it may fall out, that a man is to make it but half as great again, or more or less, as he thinketh good, or as occasion serveth, which the Architector is also to learn of necessitie. Which to shew, I set down a right four square thing marked A. B C, D, which I will have three quarters greater: the same three quarters I set by the side thereof, so that the same with the Quadrate together make a Quadrangle A. E. C. G. To bring this Quadrangle into a right Quadrate, you must lengthen the line A. E. yet a quarter longer, or from the side of the quadrangle E. G, and place F. there: then upon the line A. F. make half a Circle: which line will shew you the one side of the Quadrate which you seek for: which Quadrate being made, will contain as much in it as the Quadrangle already made. And in this manner you may change all Quadrangles which are long four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd pieces of work, into a just and true Quadrate.</p>

               <p>AGain, you may easily change a Quadrate into a Quadrangle, as long or as narrow as you desire to have it, doing thus; Make your Quadrate A. B. C. D and lengthen your Line A.

               <p>IF the Quadrate stretcheth further out, so that the two longer sides were eighteen a piece, then the shortest sides must each have two to have fourty upon the line, but the space should contain but six and thirty. And hereby you see what a perfect forme may do against an imperfect. And this rule the Workman shall use, that he may not be deceived, when he will change one forme into another.</p>

               <p>IF a man should make three Points, (which should not stand upon a right line) and desiring to have a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made, the Compass must pass along upon each of these Points. To do it from the point one to the point two, he must draw a line, and from the point two to the point three another: which two lines shall each of them be divided into two equal parts, and setting the squires half way in them, as you see it in the Figure, by that Cross it will shew you the Center, wherein you must set one foot of the Compass, and with the other draw the Circle through all the said points.</p>
               <p>YOu may find the Center of three points another way, without your Compass, making a two-corner'd <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie</hi> from the one point to the other, through the which corners two straight lines being drawn long enough downwards where they cross one over the other, they will shew you the Center of the three points.</p>
               <p>BUt for that a Workman holds this to be a superfluous speech, and a thing of no moment, it may be that a Workman may have a piece of a round work to do, which he is to perfect and make full round, by this rule he may find the Center, Circumference, and Diameter thereof, as the Figure sheweth.</p>

When he hath the wideness of the height, then he must make half a Circle out of the middle: after that, upon the same Center, he must make another lesser Circle, which must be no greater then he will make the height of the Bowe, or Arch: then he must divide the greatest Circle in equal parts, which must all be drawn with lines to the Center: then you must hang out other Perpendiculars upon your Lead: and where the lines that go to the Center cut through the lesse Circle, from thence you must draw the cross lines tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward the Perpendicular, and where they close together-there the Bowe or Arch which is made, shall be closed: as by the points or pricks hereunder is shewed.</p>
               <p>BUt if you desire to make the Bowe or Arch lower, then you must follow the rule aforesaid, and make the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Circle so much less, which is to be understood, that the more parts that you make of the greater Circle, so much the easier you shall draw the crooked lines which you would have: from this rule there are many others observed, as hereafter you shall see.</p>

               <p>CAlling the former rule to minde, I devised the manner how to forme and fashion divers kinds of vessels by the same, and I think it not amiss to set down some of them: This only is to be marked, that as wide as you will make the vessels within, so great you must make the innermost Circle. The rest, the skilful Workman may mark by the Figures, that is, how the lines are drawn to the Center, and the Parables, and out of the small Circle. The Perpendiculars hanging, the vessels are formed: the foot and the neck may be made as the Workman will.</p>
               <p>BUt if you will make the body of the vessel thicker, then you must make the half Circle so much the greater, and make the belly hanging down under it, to touch the great Circle, by the falling of the Perpendiculars upon the cross line, as by these Figures 3.4.5. it is shewed: whereby a man by this meanes may make divers vessels, differing from mine.

               <p>THis <hi>Octogonus</hi> or eight points is drawn out of a right four corner'd square, drawing the <hi>Diagonus</hi> which will shew you the Center: then set one foot of your Compass upon the corners of the Quadrate, and leading the other foot through the Center, directing your Circle toward the side of the Quadrate, there your eight points shall stand to make it eight corner'd, and although a man might only do it by the Circle, making a cross therein, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding each quarter in two, yet it will not be so well, and therefore this is a surer and more perfect way.</p>

But first you must frame the Egge in thi manner: Make a streight cross of two lines, and divide your cross line in ten equal parts: that is, on each side five. Then, set the Compass upon the Center A, and with the other foot thereof, draw in two parts, that is, to C. making half a Circle upwards. That done, set one foot of the Compass upon the point marked B and with the other draw in the uttermost point C. drawing a piece of a Circle downwards toward the Perpendicular, and doing the like on the other side, you must make a point below. Then take the half of the half Circle above that two parts, and place it a the undermost point of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular upwards above O, where the Center to close the Egge, shall stand: the rest under shall be for the foot: the neck, without doubt, may be made two parts high, and the rest according to the Workmans pleasure, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Figure here set down.</p>
               <p>YOu may also make another forme of a Cup or vessel, after the rule aforesaid. But from the point A. (which doth shew the bredth of the foot, and the wideness of the mouth) you must make your Circle upwards from C. unto the two Perpendiculars, where the body shall be closed up. The neck standing above it shall be two parts high: but the rest of the Workmanship shall be made according to the will and device of the Workman.</p>

               <p>A Man may make a vessel only by a Circular forme, making therein a circular cross, and dividing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry line into six parts: the half-circle shall be the belly of the vessel, and a sixt part upward for a Freese, that there may be more place to beautifie it: another part shall be the height of the neck, and another part the corner: and for the foot, although it be but half a part high, it may well go a sixth, part without the round: and although I have set down but six manner of cups or vessels, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule aforesaid, a man may make an infinite number of vessels, and a man may alter them by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, whereof I say nothing that you may see the line the better.</p>
